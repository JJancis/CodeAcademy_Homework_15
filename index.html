            native to Japan and was originally bred as a hunting dog to go after
            boars, birds and even bears!

          <h2>1. Shiba Inus Have a Unique Look</h2>
          <p>
            A fox, that is not actually a fox. Oh yeah, that‚Äôs how a Shiba Inu
            looks. The cute looks of a fox and the ever-charming personality of
            a dog.

          <h2>2. Shiba Inus Do Not Bark</h2>
          <p>
            The Shiba Inu does not bark, but it is far from quiet. It can
            vocalize quite readily. In fact, it will wail with a high-pitched
            voice when things don‚Äôt please it and let you know, by whining, when
            it wants attention.
          </p>

            3. Shiba Inus Can Really Cause a Commotion if They Don‚Äôt Like
            Something
          </h2>
          <p>
            If it does not like something or receives a minor injury, it will
            vocalize, in a high-pitched voice, its dissatisfaction. For
            instance, if it gets a small pebble in its paw, it will let you
            know, without hesitation, about the discomfort.
